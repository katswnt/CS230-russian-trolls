# CS230-russian-trolls
Final project from Wellesley College's CS230 Data Structures course

This project analyzes a subset of the GitHub data using Java programs we created in conjunction with TwitterTrails, an online platform for analyzing the truth of a story via crowd verification and behavior. Run by the TRAILS research team at Wellesley College (including our professor, Takis Metaxas), the platform tracks viral stories on Twitter and how Twitter users interact with disinformation. We were provided a dataset that included 287 trolls (RATs) and 609 stories they tweeted about. We sought to understand trends amongst the RATs and their interaction with the stories.
