# CS230-russian-trolls
Final project from Wellesley College's CS230 Data Structures course

This project analyzes a subset of the GitHub data using Java programs we created in conjunction with TwitterTrails, an online platform for analyzing the truth of a story via crowd verification and behavior. The platform tracks viral stories on Twitter and how Twitter users interact with disinformation. We were provided a dataset that included 287 Russian troll accounts created by the Internet Research Agency (RATs) and 609 stories around the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election that the RATs tweeted about. We sought to understand trends amongst the RATs and their interaction with the stories.
